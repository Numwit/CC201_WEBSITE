            <h5 data-aos="fade-down" data-aos-duration="1100">According to Jabil (2024), a global manufacturing company, 
                the prospects for virtual and augmented reality are promising as the market expands through headsets, tablets,
                smartphones, wearables, and consoles. Furthermore, they stated that virtual and augmented reality technologies
                will consolidate and emerge in two forms: tethered systems and standalone units. <br><br> <b>Tethered systems</b> will involve
                a wearable device, such as a head-mounted unit, connected via wire to an external processing unit <br><br> <b>Standalone units</b> 
                will integrate all necessary components, including display and processing, directly into the wearable device. <br><br> 
                Manufacturers are already adopting a mix of these approaches, although standalone units remain more complex and challenging 
                to implement. Currently, AR/VR devices are in a transitional phase, offering compromised experiences due to limitations like 
                narrow fields of view, low display resolution, reduced brightness, short battery life, and insufficient 3D sensing capabilities. 
                <br><br>Experts anticipate it will take three to five years before we achieve truly unconstrained AR/VR applications. Early successes, 
                such as Pokémon Go, have demonstrated the potential of mobile AR, but this is merely a glimpse of what is possible. As extended 
                reality technologies and markets mature, we are likely to witness a significant platform shift. Future AR glasses, potentially 
                featuring LTE connectivity, could replace smartphones within the next few years, revolutionizing how we interact with technology. 
                With advances in immersive technology and AR capabilities, consumer electronics will undergo a transformation, enabling everyday 
                tasks like checking messages or browsing social media through augmented reality devices, fundamentally altering how we engage with 
                the digital world.<br><br>
